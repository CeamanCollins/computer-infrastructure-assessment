    "In this section I will be extending the Lady Tasting Tea experiment to determine whether I would consider extending or relaxing the p-value threshold compared to the original design.\n",

    "I will do this by creating a new experiment using 12 cups: 8 that had the tea added first and 4 with the milk added first. Then I will simulate an experiment using `numpy` by randomly shuffling the cups many times and calculating the probability of the participant identifying all cups by chance and comparing my result with the original 8-cup experiment."
